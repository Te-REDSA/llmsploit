llmsploit.py

LLM + Metasploit automation — control the Metasploit Framework using natural language commands powered by local Large Language Models.

Overview

llmsploit.py is a Python tool that connects a local LLM (via Ollama
 or any CLI-accessible model) to the Metasploit RPC API.
It lets you type natural language like:

scan target 192.168.1.10 for open ports


…and the LLM will translate it into valid Metasploit commands, execute them through msfrpcd, and return results — all without leaving your terminal.

✨ Features

Natural language → Metasploit (LLM translates your instructions)

⚡ Full RPC support (use, set, exploit, run, sessions, etc.)

Command history & logging

🤖 Autonomous mode (--auto) to let the LLM plan and execute multi-step workflows

🔒 Local-only by design (no cloud models needed)

Getting Started
1. Install prerequisites

Metasploit Framework

sudo apt install metasploit-framework


Start msfrpcd

msfrpcd -U msf -P yourpassword -a 127.0.0.1


Ollama with a model (e.g. mistral, phi3, llama3)

ollama pull mistral

2. Clone and run
git clone https://github.com/Te-REDSA/llmsploit.git
cd llmsploit
python3 llmsploit.py

🖥️ Usage
Interactive mode
python3 llmsploit.py


Example:

You: search smb exploit
LLM Suggests: search type:exploit smb
Metasploit Output: [list of exploits...]

Autonomous mode

Let the LLM plan a chain of actions:

python3 llmsploit.py --auto

🛠 Roadmap

 Web UI dashboard

 Multi-LLM support (switch models easily)

 Integration with session management (post modules, Meterpreter)

 Config file for persistent settings
